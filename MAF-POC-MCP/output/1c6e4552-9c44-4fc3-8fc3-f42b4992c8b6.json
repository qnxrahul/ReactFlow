Until then, we are mostly advisers, guides, and inspirers, but sometimes cajolers and even pleaders. I've seen the Chair as a position where we can help develop the senior management team to learn new skills and approaches to persistent historical problems. All great leaders are great teachers."

Manufacturers re-engineer their products, substitute new materials, find ways to reduce waste, and find new suppliers. A significant piece of the inflation in the UK was due to energy. To illustrate this point, I pay nine cents per kilowatt hour in my home in Florida for my electrical energy. I pay 59 pence per kilowatt hour of energy in the UK, about eight times as much as in the United States. Therefore, any energy-intensive process manufacturing was crushed and cannot compete long term in the UK. We understand the obvious smelting and steelmaking processes, but a surprising component of this problem is manufacturing cars, where the paint process is hugely energy intensive. One way around this might be using body films instead of paint."

Typically, the higher the demand overshoot/undershoot, the shorter it lasts, as companies in the supply chain work to clear the excess inventory quickly. Regular readers will remember my forecasts of high energy costs and the consequence of panic buying during the illusory demand increase as the global economy restarted post-COVID-19.

A similar phenomenon of channel demand contractions to those in the electronics industry happens in construction. End market conditions change, and the channel adjusts quickly to new circumstances. It does this in both directions: increasing or decreasing demand. So, there's reason to expect that, as the calendar year 2024 unfolds, we will see improving demand conditions in the construction segment of Flex-Tek. The aviation segment of Flex-Tek remains robust as the demand for new airplanes increases rapidly."

The US Federal Reserve Bank has an inflation target of 2% and is still cautious, but perhaps unnecessarily. US housing starts have begun to increase again. It's reasonable to expect that the upward trend in housing starts will continue and will accelerate once the Federal Reserve either pauses or ultimately reduces interest rates. In conclusion, the pressure on our construction-oriented business will ease."

The Bureau publishes overall GDP numbers in a sequence of three estimates, but one of the most important Table 2 entries is the heading \"Change in private inventories\". In the first quarter of calendar year 2023, the change in private inventories was a full negative 214 basis points of GDP, indicating that the economy was, as expected, reducing inventories on a large-scale basis. The contribution to US GDP of change in private inventories in the second quarter is a positive 14 basis points, suggesting an easing in the inventory bleed-off. The US economy overall is running a little over 2% growth. While that may not be spectacular, it's stable in the economic context we find ourselves in."

Inflation, while climbing less steeply, remains at historic highs. Committed to tamping this down, central banks have raised rates at the briskest pace since the 1980s. The expected result is softening demand, as has been visible in most forecasts of late. Similarly concerning, economics and geopolitics are often inversely related, so just as forecasts cool, tensions around the world continue to warm. Speaking of warm, environmental concerns, percolating for years, are reaching a boiling point. Further still, more than a few would argue that things may still get worse before they get better. The macro, in short, is pretty cloudy."

We commit to five medium- term financial targets (growth, EPS, ROCE, margins, cash conversion) and all five improved year-over-year. Promisingly, we are not alone in this regard. Over half of our 15 closest peers have delivered double- digit growth across the same period. Still more encouraging, this was not driven by a one-time bounce from COVID lows (although we do benefit from still- unmet demand in several end markets) or inflationary tailwinds that will eventually weaken (roughly half our FY2023 growth came from volume). The trends we see in our business are longer-lived, with growth now extending over nine consecutive quarters. The micro, in short, looks pretty good."

During the Great Depression, Carlson introduced the photocopier and Edwin brought us FM radio. Stagflation and a raft of skyjackings in the 1970s led to the introduction of X-ray scanning in airports. Wikipedia, Skype, YouTube and Facebook were all formed shortly after the Nasdaq crash of 2001, and Uber and Airbnb were both launched during the global financial crisis of 2008-09. Necessity helps, but capabilities and capital are the true mothers of invention. Knowing that innovative companies extend their lead when storm clouds form, we increased our R&D investment by 14% in FY2022 and another 6% this year. Returns on our investments are good. Fully three points of our FY2023 growth came from new products introduced just this year alone."

Growth in energy demand may soften in any given year, but it rarely turns negative. In fact, global energy demand has only contracted three times in the past 50 years (the early '80s recession, the global financial crisis and COVID) leading to a near- quadrupling of underlying demand across this time. Over 20% of Smiths revenue comes from energy markets, where we grew 20% in FY2023. Consistent with other upward-cycling markets, continued energy growth will be driven by secular long-term forces such as decarbonisation. Our world will invest around"

Powerful long-term forces are also at work here, such as the world's ever-rising need for better security and faster screening times. You would have experienced an example of this if you weren't required to remove your laptop the last time you went through an airport checkpoint. This safer and more efficient experience is made possible by technologies like computed tomography, automated tray returns and machine learning.

It consistently grows over time (+10 times in 40 years). And it is cyclical. However, unlike energy and aviation, which are both cycling up, the global semiconductor market is coming off a record peak in 2022.

The two effects mentioned earlier - innovation and market selection - have helped our business consistently grow even as the market naturally cycles. With respect to innovation, we have a technology platform that addresses specific customer needs by applying different resin layers to metallic tubing systems. We introduced a new product in this family at the start of the fiscal year and it is beginning to scale. In terms of market selection, our penetration is highest in parts of the US where population growth is strongest, such as the southeast, south central and the midwest. In support of this, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Texas in FY2023 and completed a synergistic acquisition in Ohio at the start of FY2024. Consistent with macro forecasts, we expect the US construction downcycle to continue for a few more quarters. Consistent with past performance, however, we expect our business to post another year of growth in FY2024."

Discussion and decision-making by the Board takes the views of key stakeholders into account, in order to balance their needs, and effectively build the sustainable, long-term success of the Group. Throughout FY2023 we have matured our approach with a focus on critical business priorities that are regularly reported, underpinned by relevant data, in a global performance dashboard that allows tracking against the targets that have been set. Where needed, corrective actions were presented and discussed."

In addition, a summary of remuneration related issues raised by employees through the employee engagement survey is presented to the Committee. As part of a comprehensive schedule of Non-executive Director engagement with the workforce, in 2023 all Board members, including the Committee Chairman attended events across our regional markets to discuss culture, people priorities, employee remuneration and benefit arrangements across the Group. Details of the engagement programme and in-person site visits are summarised on page 59. The overall responsibility for workforce engagement rests with the Senior Independent Director while each Non-executive Director has responsibility for workforce engagement in a specific geographical region and business area."

There are significant judgements and estimates involved in the assumptions underlying the provision in respect of JCI asbestos litigation including the quantified projection period, the forecast number of future claims and associated claim and defence costs respectively and complex estimation methodology. Consistent with FY2022, there is significant auditor judgement involved in evaluating the assumptions and our assessment of the risk associated with this as a key audit matter remained consistent with the prior year. The Parent company has material pension plan assets and liabilities, especially in the UK. Small changes in the assumptions used to determine the liabilities, in particular those relating to discount rates, inflation and mortality can have a significant impact on the valuation of the liabilities. The effect of these matters is that we determined that the pension assumptions have a high degree of estimation uncertainty. Due to the increase in discount rates in the year, the carrying value of the pension liability has reduced by £400m in the year. Consequently, while there is significant auditor judgement involved in evaluating the assumptions, our assessment of the risk associated with this as a key audit matter indicates a decrease in the potential impact of a material misstatement on the Group financial statements in the current year."

Consistent with FY2022, we determined that Group normalised PBTCO remains the main benchmark for the Group. We determined that normalised profit before tax remains the benchmark for the Group as Smiths Group Plc is publicly traded and a profit seeking entity. The Group is well established and operates in a stable environment across multiple geographies. The profitability and prospects for future net cash inflows is important to the users of the financial statements.

As such, we based our Group materiality on Group normalised PBTCO of £392m (FY2022: £314m). Our Group materiality of £18m was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised PBTCO. When using a benchmark of normalised PBTCO to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 3% - 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.6% (FY2022: 5%) to the benchmark. Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £17.8m (FY2022: £15.8m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.4% (FY2022: 0.4%)."

In the prior year, all components were identified based on the Group's legal entities. In the current year, we considered the Flex-Tek division as a single reporting component, with the component auditor providing an opinion on the sub- consolidation prepared at the division level. This change to component scoping accounts for the reduction in the number of full scope components when compared to FY2022."

The Group's worldwide business leads to the consideration of a number of important factors which may affect future tax charges, such as: the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions; transfer pricing regulations; tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms; acquisitions; disposals; restructuring activities; and settlements or agreements with tax authorities."

The next actuarial valuation, due as at 5 April 2023, is currently in progress, with the results expected later in 2023."

Consequently, the Group ensures that the trustees' investment strategy and statements of investment principles are compatible with the Group's wider sustainability strategy. For TIGPS, where all benefits are now secured by way of annuity purchase, all investment risks including ESG and climate risk, have effectively now been eliminated. For SIPS, a significant portion of investment risks have already been eliminated through annuity purchase and the scheme's time horizon to full buy-in, hence exposure to investment risks including ESG and climate risk, continues to reduce."

These generated a weighted average fair value for LTIP of £15.03 (FY2022: £14.81), and restricted stock of £14.60 (FY2022: £14.59). Staff costs included £14m (FY2022: £15m) for share-based payments, of which £13m (FY2022: £14m) related to equity-settled share-based payments."

The impact of invoice discounting on the FY2023 balance sheet was that trade receivables were reduced by £26m (2022: £19m). Costs of discounting were £2m (FY2022: less than £1m), charged to the income statement within financing costs.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.

This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined. Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost-effective."

The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as 'mass tort' and 'class action' litigation, legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and insurance subrogation claims. These types of proceedings (or the threat of them) are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes. Any claim brought against the Group (with or without merit) could be costly to defend. These matters are inherently difficult to quantify. In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions (which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time) will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred. There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made."

So probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon. Asbestos is the longest running mass tort litigation in American history and is constantly evolving in ways that cannot be anticipated. JCI's defence strategy also generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement expenses from other defendants. Thus JCI is in an extremely rare position, and evidence from other litigation cannot be used to improve the reliability of the projections. A ten-year (FY2022: ten-year) time horizon has been used based on past experience regarding significant changes in the litigation environment that have occurred every few years and on the amount of time taken in the past for some of those changes to impact the broader asbestos litigation environment."

As a result, the incidence curve used for JCI projections excludes construction workers, and is a composite of the curves that predict asbestos exposure-related disease from shipyards and other occupations.

Historically, the asbestos litigation environment has undergone significant changes more often than every ten years. If one assumed that the asbestos litigation environment would remain unchanged for longer and extended the time horizon by one year, it would increase the pre-tax provision by £13m (FY2022: £15m) and extending it by five years would increase the pre-tax provision by £48m (FY2022: £56m). However, there are also reasonable scenarios that, given certain recent events in the US asbestos litigation environment, would result in no additional asbestos litigation for JCI beyond ten years. At this time, how the asbestos litigation environment will evolve beyond ten years is not reasonably estimable."

These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs' bar; changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels; and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems. As a result, whilst the Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by the provision, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point is such that the costs cannot be reliably estimated."
